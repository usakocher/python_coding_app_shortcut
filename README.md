# python_coding_app_shortcut

## Purpose
This app opens a gui that allows the user to add executable files to a list. Then, with a click of a button, the program will open all the programs on the list.
The idea behind this is that people usually have a certain setup when they code and this app can easily open all the programs you need at the same time without
having to click through your file system, or shortcuts. It's not just for coding though. If you have a routine when you wake up or for lunch or when you game, this
app can be used for those instances as well.
